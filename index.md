# Taking a step back and being critical

#### I have no quotes for this post but I recommend reading the book "How to Win Friends and Influence People" by Dale Carnegie. It was first published in 1936 but the wealth of information obtained from reading it is invaluable and timeless. If you do decide to pick it up, read slow and reflect after every chapter.

We're still in business folks! I am back from a month (half of a month more accurately) filled with unique and interesting experiences. I have been exploring myself, the people around me and applying every piece of valuable knowledge handed to me. Let's just say that my birthday passed around that time period and I almost forgot about it. Yeah! No biggie! My birthday week was enjoyable on smaller scale and I wouldn't have traded the people I shared it with with anyone else.

At this point in my life being super focused on things I want to get done. I realize now that I should take it at a pace to which I can enjoy the journey. This is something I've been putting into practice for the past couple of weeks. It still requires me to be a time management freak but after putting the plans into motion they stop being plans and just a way of life. Through reading a lot of book on toxic habits that we inflict on ourselves, I've come to sit back and reflect on every activity and interaction I engage with during the day.

It takes patience and being selfless to really be critical about your life and your goals. It's already a challenge to figure out who we are, but to then be critical about it and figure out who we want to be is like starting out in the gym with weights that are 5x times what we can handle. Not everyone has the willpower to even train towards reaching self-fulfillment goals and it is much easier push the struggle aside and feel comfortable. Yet, usually by the end of it, those who put in the effort avoid the permanent scars of regret. Being comfortable comes with the inevitable consequence of boredom. On the other hand, reaching personal goals keeps pushing your mind to strive towards new limits.

To paraphrase a passage from one of the books I read over the past couple of weeks: You can tell almost everything about a person based on where they get their feeling of **"self-importance"**. I think stepping back, reflecting, and being critical about where get get our feeling of importance is a good place to start looking for goals.
