# You’ll Find Me in the Lost and Found Cabinet

*This post might feel segmented and the flow might be off. It is a collection of thoughts and summarizations of what has happened throughout my year of absence edited into a blog post.*

## What is the way of thinking that you’ve made into your mantra?

Last summer, my consistency in going to the gym had cemented with my daily routine as it became a serious hobby. With time, something changed within me as I applied concepts of how I approach training towards my life and the people within my circles. There’s something different today, I still don’t know how to articulate it, but I think those who speak to me recognize it better than I can. 

**A sense of trust? A feeling of safety? An aura of respect?** I can’t describe it.
Maybe I’m just delusional?

A year ago I took the time to: find a career path, a way I could enjoy the process of learning and pushed myself towards the person I’ve wanted to be described as. This led to me reading and researching, meeting new people with constructive points of views and challenging my physical and mental strengths. While I was on this path, I had the opportunity to be entrusted to travel to Europe on behalf of my work company. The process was accelerated, it was the right set of circumstances to start anew in my habits, my career and my life choices.

Not everybody has the chance to jumpstart renewal, but I don’t think it was the key to the changes that followed. 

I should emphasize. 

As I look back at my roomate’s slothing lifestyle in contrast to mine during my stay in Europe, I now conclude that the willpower to change overcomes the circumstances from which that change has to rise from. The playing field was even (as even as it could be) for both of us but the effort I put in made the difference. It was journey of looking at a reflection of my old self while growing into the me I wanted to be. The reflection of a person not looking to progress in any personal goals and grow while being happy in staying comfortable. It’s not a bad life, but I do have a need for feeling like I am useful for a purpose. If you have any inklings of this feeling, it eventually catches up with you over time in the forms of: boredom, frustration, anger and regret. Nonetheless I do acknowledge the privilege I had to make changes free of cost.

**Change comes with discomfort.**

I don’t look at my progress often. It is a good confidence booster but it can be depressing or encouraging based on your mood and perspective in the moment of making a comparison. I tell myself I should always be improving from today’s starting point. It is a more realistic approach and avoids the paralyzing confusion effect of the grandiose picture at the end of the road. The future is filled with possibilities and challenges you'll never encounter. There is no need to stress out in solving them before your day to day challenges. My thought is that future challenges and goals are a culmination of day to day challenges anyways.

## *Aside*
I’ve been absent for a year on blog writing but it doesn’t mean I’ve lost the passion. Writing is something I love doing, but I’ve had to put it aside for other priorities to take my life in the direction I’ve always wanted to take it. This past year hasn’t been easy, a year of disciplining myself and exploring ways of making that process enjoyable. All my focus being on harsh self-criticism and progress awareness while creating and internalizing self-taught techniques to tackle obstacles that came my way. I have a lot to share and can’t wait to find a way to make these entries shorter to share them all =P.
