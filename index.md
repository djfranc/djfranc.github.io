# Welcome to The Blueprint Anthill!

### Site Summary

Welcome to the site is to be a host for my solving and analysis of hundreds of solutions on programming ideas! Ironically the book we will be using the most will is called **The Programmer Idea Book** by Martyr2 *(It's not his real name obviously...)*. Do note that I will post the source of the problem otherwise.

</p>

Every problem in the book is solved using C#, starting from easiest and ending with the hardest problems. Additionally commentary will be added by myself on the thought process to approaching the issue. Essentially most of the discussions will center around benefits and disadvantages to solving problems in my approach and how to make them: be more effective, allow for easy expansion, follow MVC when possible etc. 

Problems will be revisited to provide those alternate solutions.
Key terms to remember and reading sources will also be provided through each problem.

##### Example

In the first problem I am going to present, the solution was short enough. Fitting all the code within one class was a reasonable decision yet, my commentary will criticize that decision. Expanding my solution for the **_Additional Challenge_** for example filled the page with redundant code. The use of "Inheritance" (mainly) would have simplified the overall process.

I intend to blog alongside my solution solving for my own sanity's sake.


### A Quick Note about myself!

I do not at all consider myself to be a great coder/programmer but that may just be relative to your own expertise as a reader *(this will change, I learn quick ;) )*. I don't have much time to tend to the blog so if it's slow progress it's because I am busy.  

Heck I didn't even add a README.md to my projects yet...


## Stay Classy and Enjoy The Ride!!!

*All the projects will be on the sidebar to the right.*
*They are added well after I've completed the problem and are commented out on weekends.*
*Expect massive weekend updates*
