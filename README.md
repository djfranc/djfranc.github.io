##### Me messing around with the Automatic Template.


### This Github Pages User Site contains incorporates all the different project repos and blog repo within it.

Each Subfolder used for html navigation is a Github Project Page repo that mimics the style of file pathing.
I would encourage people to try and come up with more memory efficient methods of incorporating custom subfolders 
using the Automatic generator.

Projects are solved using The Programmer idea Book.

*This github user site is using the Architect Theme.*
