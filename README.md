## Site Summary

This site is to be a host for my solving and analysis of hundreds of solutions on programming ideas! Ironically the book we are using for the most part is called **The Programmer Idea Book** by Martyr2 *(It's not his real name obviously...)*. Do note that I will post the source of the problem otherwise.

</p>

Every problem in the book is solved using C#, starting from easiest and ending with the hardest problems. Additionally, commentary will be added by myself on the thought process to getting started. Most of the discussions center around benefits and disadvantages to solving problems in my approach. The key factors here are how to: be more effective, allow for easy expansion, follow MVC when possible and implement programming practices etc. 

*Note: Problems are revisited to provide those alternate solutions.*
*Key terms to remember and reading sources are provided.*

##### Example

In the problem, **The Tax Calculator**, the solution is short. Fitting all the code within one class is reasonable as an approach yet, my commentary criticizes that decision. Expanding my solution for the **_Additional Challenge_**  fills the IDE with redundant code. The use of "Inheritance" simplifies the overall process and opens it up for exapansion possibilities.

I intend to blog alongside my solution solving and reflect on my choices and programming practices.


### A Quick Note about myself!

I do not at all consider myself to be a great coder/programmer yet, there is no official standard. I use these problems as a way to build my skills according a scale on which I can measure myself. Although, I will be much more personal in the blog I don't have much time to tend to it... If the updates are slow it is because I am busy.  

Heck I didn't even add a README.md to my projects yet... I promise I will this weekend (Feb 24-25).


## Stay Classy and Enjoy The Ride!!!

*All the projects will be on the sidebar to the right.*
*They are added well after I've completed the problem and are commented out on weekends.*
*Expect massive weekend updates*

##### Me messing around with the Automatic Template.


### This Github Pages User Site contains incorporates all the different project repos and blog repo within it.

Each Subfolder used for html navigation is a Github Project Page repo that mimics the style of file pathing.
I would encourage people to try and come up with more memory efficient methods of incorporating custom subfolders 
using the Automatic generator.

Projects are using The Programmer Idea Book.

*This github user site is using the Architect Theme.*
