### Description:
##### Title: Tax Calculator

**Difficulty: 1**

**Description:** Create a program which asks the user to enter in a dollar value and the current tax percentage. Then print out the subtotal along with the total plus tax (grand total).

**Tips:** This is a very simple program where you collect the value from the user, have the user enter in a tax value, add the tax to the total and print out the result. If the value the user enters is $1.00 and the tax is 5% then the total is $1.05.

**Added Difficulty:** Build a GUI for this program where the user can enter in multiple prices, adds them up and then calculates the tax. Perhaps some of the items wonâ€™t be taxed based on the item type (like food).



##### **Approach:** 

First thing to do when a to see how a computer would be able to work with. 
The first sentence of the description describes the input variables, the second the output variables.
From this we have an idea of all the information that we can work with and manipulate to get the desired output result.

Input:
- Dollar value of each item 
- Tax amount

Output:
- Total (Tax+Sum)
- Subtotal (Sum)

From here we need to realize the functions we need to arrive at the necessary output. In this case we are only adding values and multiply for the tax.



If you are planning on solving the **Added Difficulty** portion with the introduction of GUI elements, I highly recommend having the GUI present from the start and working towards a solution through it instead of through a console window. 


Note: For problems of Level 1 Difficulty problem I avoid using intermediate concepts unless I clearly see a place where they can easily be understood and it simplifies the process.



For the added difficulty portion:

Everytime I make a GUI I have a habit of including a draft user story.

**USER STORIES:** 

Actor(s): User 

Stories:
- As a user I want an add button to add more than one item.
- As a user I want to be able to clear and restart my calculations.
- As a user I want to be able to take off taxes on certain items.
